# ESP32-Servo-Motor-Sweep-with-LED-Indicators

# Task 3: ESP32 Electronic Circuit with Sensor Integration

## Description

This project demonstrates a servo motor sweep using an ESP32 microcontroller. The servo motor sweeps back and forth between 0 and 180 degrees. Additionally, two LEDs indicate the direction of the servo motor: a yellow LED lights up when the servo turns left, and a blue LED lights up when the servo turns right.

## Components Used

- ESP32
- Servo Motor
- Yellow LED
- Blue LED

## Circuit Setup

   - Connect the servo motor's signal pin to GPIO 18 of the ESP32.
   - Connect the yellow LED's anode (positive pin) to GPIO 14 and the anode (positive leg) to a cathode connected to ground.
   - Connect the blue LED's Anode (positive pin) to GPIO 25 and the cathode connected to ground.
   - Ensure all grounds are common.
   - Power the ESP32 and servo motor appropriately.
